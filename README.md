# X Jailbreak Plugin Store
Plugin store for my ChatGPT Jailbreak, X Jailbreak or XJb.
To add a new plugin, make a new issue with a .xjbp file a user can add using the built in "/plugin add" command. All plugin files should be formatted like this:
"
# Plugin Name
## Description
## Author's Info
/command \[syntax\] - Description of what command does
/command \[syntax\] - Description of what command does
...
"
Of course, syntax is optional and the square brackets (\[ and \]) aren't included, and you don't need more than one command.
And the ... is for extra commands and descriptions of commands.
You can obviously add more syntax to commands, this is an example.
